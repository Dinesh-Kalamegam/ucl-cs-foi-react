# UCL Computer Science Module Mark Visualisations 

## ℹ About this website 
**LIVE WEBSITE AT** : [https://dinesh-kalamegam.github.io/ucl-cs-foi-react/](https://dinesh-kalamegam.github.io/ucl-cs-foi-react/)

My first application created in order to learn React.js.
The application the react-chartjs-2 library to create the charts 

The modules are for 3rd and 4th Year Mathematical Computation but the Computer Science modules here also apply for the BSc and MEng Computer Science programs. 

- 3rd Year is level 6 
- 4th Year is level 7

For each level you can see for 2018/9 Academic Year a bar chart comparison of the average Mean mark. Then by clicking an individual module card you will be able to see how the 5th , 25th ,75th, 95th Percentiles as well as the Mean mark varied over the academic years 2015/6-2018/9 

## 📚 Data Source 
The numerical data is from [https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/ucl_meng_computer_science_module_2#incoming-1463166](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/ucl_meng_computer_science_module_2#incoming-1463166) a Freedom Of Information Request I made myself in 2019

From the files provided I converted them into CSV files added the module codes and levels then converted those into JSON files 

I believe the 2019/20 results are also available on the information request website. HOWEVER , there would be little use putting them in here since those marks were probably skewed by COVID-19 Alternate Assessments. 

## ⚠ Disclaimer / Advice
First of all I am not responsible for any choice you make should you use this site! Namely don't base your entire decision on the data presented here. These are some other factors that you should also think about:  
- Any Unitu Feedback about the module
- How the coursework/workload throughout the term is like 
- How many coursework heavy modules are you already doing throughout the term (Remember some of you have a disseration to do as well)

# UCL Computer Science Module Mark Visualisations 

## About this website 
My first application created in order to learn React.js.

It's still a work in progress but a fair amount of the website functionality has been done and it's useable

The modules are for 3rd and 4th Year Mathematical Computation but the Computer Science modules here also apply for the BSc and MEng Computer Science programs. 

- 3rd Year is level 6 
- 4th Year is level 7

For each level you can see for 2018/9 Academic Year a comparison of the average Mean mark. Then by clicking an individual module card you will be able to see how the 5th,25th,75th,9th Percentiles as well as the Mean marks varied over the academic years 2015/6-2018/9 

## Data Source 
The numerical data is from [https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/ucl_meng_computer_science_module_2#incoming-1463166]() a Freedom Of Information Request I made myself in 2019

From the files provided I converted them into CSV files added the module codes and levels then converted those into JSON files
